# SimpleWarpGate

## What is it?

A plugin for the Spigot Minecraft server. It allows players to set up teleport points without having use commands.

Since it is meant to be simple, there are no permissions or commands, everything is done in game.

### To use

To create a gate, players simply place a sign against a regular nether portal and type the name of gate on the top line.
The gate is then created and can be teleported to from any other gate by right clicking on the sign, then clicking the button that appears on the left side of the portal.

## Install
Download the jar from the releases page on github

To install, drop the .jar file in the plugins folder of the spigot install

Then simply create gates in game.

## To compile

If you want to make changes, you will need to build the plugin using spigot, which also requires a copy of spigot locally as a dependency.

The spigot site has some guides on how to set this up
